LaTeX paper formalizing Love as a recursive energy exchange within the Unified Theory of Energy.

This paper formalizes Love as an energetic exchange within the Unified Theory of Energy (UTE), treating it as a recursive interaction of Radiation, Gravitation, and Particulate Motion. Love is defined as an emergent property of recursive energy transformations, tracing its ultimate origin to the set of all possible Radiation frequencies, interpreted as the divine source of energy. We establish mathematical relationships that demonstrate Love as a conserved energy process, mapping its behavior across increasing Degrees of Surface Interaction.
